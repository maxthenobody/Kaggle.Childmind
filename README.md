## 1. Project Overview

This project addresses the **Child Mind Institute Problematic Internet Use (PIU)** competition on Kaggle, focusing on developing machine learning models to predict problematic internet use in children and adolescents. The solution leverages a diverse dataset comprising demographic, behavioural and actigraphy data.

The primary goal was to build a robust classification model capable of identifying individuals at risk of PIU, contributing to early intervention strategies and improved mental health outcomes for young people.

## 2. Problem Statement

Problematic Internet Use (PIU) is a growing concern, impacting mental health and daily functioning in children and adolescents. Early identification of PIU is crucial for effective intervention. This project aimed to create a predictive model by analyzing complex features from multiple data sources such as actigraphy, demographic and behavioral data to accurately classify individuals with PIU.

## 3. Dataset

The dataset provided by the Child Mind Institute (via Kaggle) includes:

    Demographics - Information about age and sex of participants.
    Internet Use - Number of hours of using computer/internet per day.
    Children's Global Assessment Scale - Numeric scale used by mental health clinicians to rate the general functioning of youths under the age of 18.
    Physical Measures - Collection of blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight and waist, and hip measurements.
    FitnessGram Vitals and Treadmill - Measurements of cardiovascular fitness assessed using the NHANES treadmill protocol.
    FitnessGram Child - Health related physical fitness assessment measuring five different parameters including aerobic capacity, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition.
    Bio-electric Impedance Analysis - Measure of key body composition elements, including BMI, fat, muscle, and water content.
    Physical Activity Questionnaire - Information about children's participation in vigorous activities over the last 7 days.
    Sleep Disturbance Scale - Scale to categorize sleep disorders in children.
    Actigraphy - Objective measure of ecological physical activity through a research-grade biotracker.
    Parent-Child Internet Addiction Test - 20-item scale that measures characteristics and behaviors associated with compulsive use of the Internet including compulsivity, escapism, and dependency.

    ### Actigraphy Files and Field Descriptions ###
    During their participation in the HBN study, some participants were given an accelerometer to wear for up to 30 days continually while at home and going about their regular daily lives.

    series_{train|test}.parquet/id={id} - Series to be used as training data, partitioned by id. Each series is a continuous recording of accelerometer data for a single subject spanning many days.
    id - The patient identifier corresponding to the id field in train/test.csv.
    step - An integer timestep for each observation within a series.
    X, Y, Z - Measure of acceleration, in g, experienced by the wrist-worn watch along each standard axis.
    enmo - As calculated and described by the wristpy package, ENMO is the Euclidean Norm Minus One of all accelerometer signals (along each of the x-, y-, and z-axis, measured in g-force) with negative values rounded to zero. Zero values are indicative of periods of no motion. While no standard measure of acceleration exists in this space, this is one of the several commonly computed features.
    anglez - As calculated and described by the wristpy package, Angle-Z is a metric derived from individual accelerometer components and refers to the angle of the arm relative to the horizontal plane.
    non-wear_flag - A flag (0: watch is being worn, 1: the watch is not worn) to help determine periods when the watch has been removed, based on the GGIR definition, which uses the standard deviation and range of the accelerometer data.
    light - Measure of ambient light in lux. See ​​here for details.
    battery_voltage - A measure of the battery voltage in mV.
    time_of_day - Time of day representing the start of a 5s window that the data has been sampled over, with format %H:%M:%S.%9f.
    weekday - The day of the week, coded as an integer with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday.
    quarter - The quarter of the year, an integer from 1 to 4.
    relative_date_PCIAT - The number of days (integer) since the PCIAT test was administered (negative days indicate that the actigraphy data has been collected before the test was administered).

    * **Target Variable: Severity Impairment Index (SII)** Multiclass classification identifying the level of Problematic Internet Use (PIU).


## 4. Methodology & Approach

This project followed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Loading & Initial Exploration:**
    * Loaded and understood the various data formats (parquet for actigraphy, CSV for tabular data).
    * Performed initial sanity checks and basic statistical analyses.

2.  **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering Hightlights:**
    * **Actigraphy Data:** Extracted robust statistical features from various and unique data aggregation.
    * **Tabular Data:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and engineered meaningful features.
    * **Data Integration:** Developed strategies to combine features extracted from actigraphy with demographic and behavioral data into a unified dataset for model training.

3.  **Model Selection & Architecture:**
    * Explored various machine learning models suitable for classification.
    * Gradient boosting decision tree models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, Catboost were used and ensmebled.
    * Even though it's a classification problem, the target variable is ordinal, hence regression models were used and the predictions were postprocessed into classses using SciPy's scipy.optimize.minimize method which finds optimal thresholds.

4.  **Training & Validation:**
    * Utilized StratifiedKFold to ensure model generalization.
    * Monitored training progress using metrics like RMSE loss and Quadratic Weighted Kappa(QWK).
    * Applied techniques to prevent overfitting (e.g., dropout, early stopping, L1/L2 regularization).
  
5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning & Feature Selection:**
    * Used Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, a state-of-the-art open source library for automated hyperparameter search. https://optuna.org/
    * Used SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature selection, a state-of-the-art open source library for explaining machine learning model outputs. https://shap.readthedocs.io/

6.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluated the final model performance on an unseen test set using QWK, the primary competition metric.
    * Performed interpretability analyses to understand which features contributed most to predictions, using SHAP.

## 5. Results & Key Findings

* **Achieved QWK Score:** My model achieved a QWK score of **0.461** on the final test set, demonstrating moderate performance. However, considering the winner of the competition's score is 0.482, it seemed meaningful improvements were not feasible with the given dataset.
* **[Your Key Insight 1]:** Briefly describe an important discovery or pattern observed (e.g., "Functional connectivity features extracted from specific brain regions proved to be highly indicative of PIU.").
* **[Your Key Insight 2]:** Another finding (e.g., "The integration of demographic data significantly improved model robustness, suggesting a synergistic effect with neuroimaging features.").

**Future Enhancements could include:**
* Exploring more advanced deep learning architectures for multimodal data fusion.
* Integrating external datasets for transfer learning or data augmentation.
* Conducting more in-depth feature importance analysis to identify critical biomarkers of PIU.
* Investigating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to make model predictions more interpretable for clinical applications.
